# AestheticExperienceNetwork
## Description of the project
The project aims to
- develop a system for visualizing a dataset that is intended to represent eight networks that model an aesthetic experience of the viewers when observing artworks;
- create impactful charts or infographics from data through D3.js (JavaScript library).

The dataset used in the project are the result of the research presented in the article "Associating With Art: A Network Model of Aesthetic Effects by Specker et al" which was shared by the authors of the article to have the opportunity to know "how to visualize this data set for an art historical audience or other audience that does not know about network theory."
